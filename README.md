Web API Challenge 4: An interactive JavaScript quiz written in JavaScript

I wrote a code quiz using JavaScript. At first, the index.html page will present the user with the instructions, a start button, and a timer of 45 seconds. When the quiz is started, the timer will begin counting down while the user is presented 6 multiple choice questions. Clicking on any of the answers will advance to the next question. If the answer selected was incorrect, the user will be docked 10 seconds and a "wrong" message is displayed. Choosing the correct answer results in no time penalty and a "correct" message being displayed.
